# BITS State Files

This folder contains already-made sample state files. They can be used to override your own state files at:
```
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Network\Downloader\qmgr*.dat
```

Their names suggest their content, open them with the supplied *010 editor* template parser to examine them in full.

Different OS versions offer different BITS versions (see qmgr.dll versions), and thus the OS seperation in folders.
