# BITS Job Payloads

This folder contains the extracted serialized data that represents a SYSTEM job. This data is used as a base for the properties modifications that BITSInject.py allows.

Different OS versions offer different BITS versions (see qmgr.dll versions), and thus the OS seperation in folders.
